## README format

Elite recommends the following README formatting:

1. Headings capitalized with an initial capital.
2. Headings prefixed with `#/##/###/####` to indicate level of heading (`h1/h2/h3/h4`) followed by a blank line
3. Two lines prior to `##/###` headings
4. No leading or trailing spaces
5. Bulleted lists denoted by dashes (`-`)
6. Ordered lists use "1", for easier updates and to avoid errors
7. Nested lists indented with 4 spaces
8. Links should have a meaningful link text. for example:
   `[elite](https://github.com/usanaphtal112/elite-git-practice-v2)` (i.e. not just the URL)
