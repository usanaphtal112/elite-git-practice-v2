## Machine Learning and Deep Learning Skills

Machine learning is a powerful field that leverages data and algorithms to make predictions and automate tasks. I have experience in various aspects of machine learning, including natural language processing and computer vision.

### Sentiment Analysis with Web Scraping and Natural Language Processing

#### Sentiment Analysis with Web Scraping and NLP

Sentiment analysis is a valuable application of natural language processing (NLP) that involves analyzing text data to determine the sentiment or emotional tone of the content.

#### Project Description

I have successfully completed a project on sentiment analysis that includes:

- **Web Scraping**: I scraped and collected textual data from various online sources, including social media, reviews, and news articles.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: I applied NLP techniques to preprocess and analyze the text data, including tokenization, text cleaning, and feature extraction.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Using machine learning models, I classified the text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- **Visualizations**: I created visualizations to display sentiment trends and patterns.

### Image Processing (Face Detection and Verification) with CNN using Triplets Loss Function

#### Image Processing (Face Detection and Verification)

Image processing and computer vision are essential components of machine learning, particularly in tasks such as face detection and verification.

#### Project Description

I have worked on a project involving image processing and convolutional neural networks (CNN) with the triplets loss function:

- **Face Detection**: I implemented a face detection system that can identify and locate faces within images or video streams.
- **Face Verification**: I developed a face verification model that can verify whether two given images belong to the same person or not.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: I utilized CNNs for feature extraction and representation learning, enabling robust face recognition.
- **Triplets Loss Function**: The use of the triplets loss function helped optimize the model for improved face verification accuracy.
